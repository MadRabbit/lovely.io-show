# Episode 1, Show Me Some Love

[This episode](http://lovely.io/show/show-me-some-love) shows the basics of
the [lovely.io](http://lovely.io) structure, the packages usage and principles
involved in the project.

__NOTE__: This is a remake of the episode which was originally made in Aug 2011,
because I lived in the beautiful St.Petersburg, which as you might know is near
the polar circle and you can't really sleep in summer in there, coz the sun
almost never goes down, and you tired as fuck, and you get slow and grumpy and
your screencasts suck.

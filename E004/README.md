# Lovely.IO Show E005

In [this episode](http://lovely.io/show/you-first-dom-wrapper) of the
[lovely.io show](http://lovely.io/show) we continue to work on our little
rails based blogging application.

This time we explore the nature of object oriented dom-wrappers and how
those things work in `lovely.io`. We convert some of our spaghetti code
from the previous episode into a class and show how it all works.

## How To Use

This is a [rails](http://rubyonrails.org) application, so you'll need to
get `ruby`, `gems`, `rails` and run this app as a usual rails app.

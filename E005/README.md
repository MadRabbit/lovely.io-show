# Lovely.IO Show E005

In [this episode](http://lovely.io/show/mvc-is-everywhere) of the
[lovely.io show](http://lovely.io/show) we continue to work on our little
rails based blogging application.

This time we show how to make local modules for lovely.io and convert your
simple dom-wrappers into proper MVC controllers.

## How To Use

This is a [rails](http://rubyonrails.org) application, so you'll need to
get `ruby`, `gems`, `rails` and run this app as a usual rails app.
